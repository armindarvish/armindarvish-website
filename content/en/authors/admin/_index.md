I received my PhD in biomedical engineering from Drexel University in 2016, where I studied solid state nanopores as biosensors for novel applications including nucleic acid detection, protein characterization, and sensing/characterization of viruses. Since then, I have worked for multiple companies with a focus on developing integrated biosensing platforms for applications such as molecular diagnostics and DNA sequencing.

I have a broad background in multidisciplinary science and technology, with several years of experience in single-molecule biosensing platforms. In the various projects I have been involved with, I gained hands-on experience in materials science, process engineering, micro/nanofabrication, signal and image processing, multiphysics modeling, experimental design, statistical data analysis, machine learning, data science, and bioinformatics as well as molecular biochemistry. I have also had the opportunity to learn personal and project management skills from working with great inspiring teams both in academia and the industry.

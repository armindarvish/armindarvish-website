  - title: "Lead Scientist"
    company: "Bosch"
    company_url: "https://www.bosch.us/"
    location: "California"
    date_start: "2019-10-15"
    date_end: ""
    description: |
        At Bosch, I am a scientist in the “Bioelectronics” team within the corporate research organization. We design novel biosensors and take them from early stage proof-of-concept to the productization phase before handing them off to other business units within Bosch. My focus has been platform development and integration based on novel electrical nanobiosensors for single-molecule applications. I perform a wide range of tasks from making devices in the clean room to characterizing them using analytical techniques to designing and conducting single-molecule experiments as well as signal processing and data analysis.

  - title: "Senior Scientist"
    company: "Quantapore"
    company_url: "https://quantapore.com/"
    location: "California"

    description: |
        had a broad range of responsibilities covering development and optimization of Quantapore’s proprietary nanopore-based sequencing technology. This involves process development and integration for nanopore chip design and manufacturing as well as running sequencing experiments to optimize the overall platform, and bring the idea from a proof-of-concept to a market-ready product
    
  - title: "Nanopore Engineer"
    company: "Two Pore Guys | Ontera"
    location: "California"
    date_start: "2016-07-01"
    date_end: "2018-06-30"
    description: |
        Worked with a team of scientists and engineers with broad range of responsibilities falling under product development category. I was the project lead for transferring the nanopore sensors from lab-scale proof-of-concept to mass-scale production as well as implementing quality control and testing. This included interfacing with manufacturing partners and subcontractors to establish a manufacturing pipeline.

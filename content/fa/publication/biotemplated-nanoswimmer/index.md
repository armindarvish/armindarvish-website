abstract: "In this article, a porous hollow biotemplated nanoscale helix that can serve as a low Reynolds number robotic swimmer is reported. The nanorobot utilizes repolymerized bacterial flagella from Salmonella typhimurium as a nanotemplate for biomineralization. We demonstrate the ability to generate templated nanotubes with distinct helical geometries by using specific alkaline pH values to fix the polymorphic form of flagellar templates. Using uniform rotating magnetic fields to mimic the motion of the flagellar motor, we explore the swimming characteristics of these silica templated flagella and demonstrate the ability to wirelessly control their trajectories. The results suggest that the biotemplated nanoswimmer can be a cost-effective alternative to the current top-down methods used to produce helical nanorobots."

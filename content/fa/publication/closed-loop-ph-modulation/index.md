abstract: "Provided is a method for monitoring a change of ion strength in a sample solution by a closed-loop device that provides continuous cycling of electrochemical pH modulation between pre-defined pH values. In particular, the change of ion strength may be induced by a chemical reaction and may ultimately alter the electrical control parameters of the closed-loop device. By measuring such electrical control parameters, the degree and progress of the underlying chemical reaction may be monitored."

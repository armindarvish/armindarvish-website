Hello, my name is Aidan Scannell and I am a postdoctoral researcher with interests at the intersection of probabilistic machine 
learning, control theory and robotics.
I am currently a  [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://fcai.fi/) postdoctoral researcher 
at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) 
in Joni Pajarinen's [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.aalto.fi/)
and Arno Solin's [Machine Learning Research Group](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/).
The postdoc is focused on "Model-based reinforcement learning under uncertainty".

<!-- ["Bayesian Learning for Control in Multimodal Dynamical Systems"](https://github.com/aidanscannell/phd-thesis) from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Professor Arthur Richards and Dr Carl Henrik Ek. -->

I obtained my PhD from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Professor Arthur Richards and Dr Carl Henrik Ek.
If you're interested, my PhD thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/aidanscannell/phd-thesis).
It presents novel methods for controlling robotic systems subject to unknown, multimodal dynamics, where some of 
the underlying dynamics modes are believed to be inoperable. 
For example, controlling quadcopters subject to turbulent dynamics modes in unknown locations.
